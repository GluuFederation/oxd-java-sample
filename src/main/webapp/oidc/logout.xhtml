            After End-User has logged out, the Client might request to log him out of the OP too. For this, a logout URL
            is obtained and End-User's browser is redirected to such location. Then OP will make the browser return
            to a predefined <b>"Post Logout Uri"</b> that was supplied (or set) during site registration.
        </p>

        <p>
            <br />
            The following logout URL was obtained:
        </p>

        <p><code>#{sessionUtil.logoutUrl}</code></p>

        <p>
            <br />
            Click the button to end our sample flow.
        </p>
